## Reporting a Vulnerability

In order to report a vulnerability, go to issues and create an issue with the bug label.  
Give it a matching title to the vulnerability if possible.  
Describe the Issue and make sure I know where the security issue is if it's with the  
code. 
And finally: Submit the issue so I can see what I can do :D
